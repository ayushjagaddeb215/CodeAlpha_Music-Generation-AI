# CodeAlpha_Music-Generation-AI
This project demonstrates how to generate music using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network trained on a dataset of MIDI files. The model learns patterns from musical sequences and produces new, AI-composed instrumental music in a classical piano style.

# ðŸŽ¶ AI Music Generation using LSTM | CodeAlpha Internship - Task 3

This project demonstrates how to generate music using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network trained on a dataset of MIDI files. The model learns musical patterns and produces new, AI-composed instrumental music in a classical piano style.
